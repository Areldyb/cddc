A Python implementation of Problem Sleuth's most famous non-canon cannon, the **Catenative Doomsday Dice Cascader**.

Literally no one asked for this.

Default behavior is slow but fun, matching the feel of the original comic page.  
Command line options:  
--quick *(no delays, only show dice result lines)*  
--resultonly *(only output the final damage total. overrides --quick)*  
--machinereadable *(output a list of all the dice results without any formatting prettiness. overrides --quick and --resultonly)*  
--wasp *(maximum disappointment due to Professor Wasp's meddling. always prime bubble 6, always final result 1)*
